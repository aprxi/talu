# UV Configuration
# https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/settings/
#
# The Makefile configures all tools to store caches outside the project:
#   - UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT → ~/.cache/uv/venvs/talu-python
#   - RUFF_CACHE_DIR → ~/.cache/ruff
#   - pytest cache_dir → ~/.cache/pytest (via --override-ini)
#
# This keeps the repo clean and allows read-only mounts.
# Always use `make lint`, `make test`, etc. rather than raw `uv run` commands.
